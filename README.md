# SymAsym
Built of the SymAsym Amp and a bit additional stuff around it

About
I'll build the famous SymAsym Amp itself, mount it in a case and wrap a little Controller and Speaker Protection around it.

Right now the project is a bit of a mess, need to get things togehter and write a proper documentation.
